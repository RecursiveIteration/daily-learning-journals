# Code 201, Day 15

In Friday's class we worked on code reviewing Git PR's.  We went over how to look at the changes being made and how to give feedback to the author through comments in the code.  We then got to practice by performing code review on our peer's work.

Afterwards, we discussed our final projects and what was being asked of us.  We went over User Scenarios a little more and received some advice about how to scope out our projects to keep them manageable.
