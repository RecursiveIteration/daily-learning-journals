# Code 201, Day 20

Today we put a few small finishing touches on our project. Mainly we just reworded a few things on our index page for a better user experience.  We gave a practice presentation which went ok though I felt I hadn't given it enough thought last night. But the rehearsal was enough to get us to a good place for our actual presentation this afternoon. I felt it went very well and everyone gave a great talk!
