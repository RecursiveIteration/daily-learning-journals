# Code 201, Day 2
Today we covered a little more java script.  We learned how to reference a javascript file from the .html file with the <script src=""> tag.  I also looked up a bunch of keyboard shortcuts to make my life easier.  Some of these shortcuts include the following:
- [Ctrl-Shift-i] in the browser to bring up the dev tools.
- [Ctrl-F5] in the browser to refresh the webpage.
- [Ctrl-Shift-q] in Atom to launch the webpage from the index.html document.
- [Ctrl-l] in Atom to select the current line of code.
- [Ctrl-/] in Atom to comment/uncomment the currently selected code.
We also learned more about using Git.  We learned to create repo's on Github and then pull them to our computer.  We also learned how to create repos on our PC and then sinc them with a new Github repo using the command:
git remote add <name> <url>.
