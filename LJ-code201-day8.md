# Code 201, Day 8

Today in class we learned about forms.  How to create them in our HTML document with tags such as the following:
* &lt;form>&lt;/form>
* &lt;fieldset>&lt;/fieldset>
* &lt;label>&lt;/label>
* &lt;input />

We also talked about events.  We discussed how to capture events in our JavaScript code by creating a reference to a DOM element and adding an event listener to it.  We also talked a bit about how anonymous functions are often used in the event listener method calls to handle the events.
