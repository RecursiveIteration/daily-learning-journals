# Code 201, Day 18

Today we worked on styling our website. We began somewhat independently, working on stylesheets for our individual pages. Later we decided to merge our stylesheets into one file that all our web pages would share.  This took some time, but the end result was a website that had a similar look-and-feel as you navigated around it. We spent a little time going over our stretch goals to see what we felt was manageable with the time we have remaining.
