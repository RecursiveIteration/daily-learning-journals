# Code 201, Day 19

Today we put the finishing touches on our hike-finding app and deployed it to gh-pages. We were able to fit in a few of our stretch goals, which felt good, and we were also able to clean up the look-and-feel of our site.  We added 12 additional hikes and threw in new logic to help narrow things down to a single hike by discriminating over the differences in three new factors:
  * trail length
  * elevation gain
  * trail quality
