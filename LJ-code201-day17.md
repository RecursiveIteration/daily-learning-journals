# Code 201, Day 17

Today we got our project to MVP.  We spent the bulk of the day 'mob programming'. We were able to create a basic index page that acted as a form where users could select parameters for a hike they would be interested in taking.  The page stores the input of the form in localStorage and sends the user to a results page where a hike is displayed to them. We also created a basic journal page where a user can input details about the hikes they've taken and store that information in localStorage.
