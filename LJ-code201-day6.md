# Code 201, Day 6

Today I learned that JavaScript is actually a form of ECMAScript.  I also learned about the <caniuse.com> website for checking which browsers can handle a specific type of css element.

In class we discussed object literals and the DOM tree structure.  Some of the more interesting insights came in the form of learning how JavaScript stores arrays:
* they are stored as key-value pairs
* the key is a number cast as a string
* as such, they don't require the full array to be stored from the zero index as they do in many other languages
