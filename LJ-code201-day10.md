# Code 201, Day 10

In Friday's class we learned about error handling in JavaScript. We talked about the call stack and explored ways to trouble shoot our code.  Some of the things we looked at to aid us in trouble shooting included the following:
* Using console.log() statements to help track script progression.
* Placing break points in the script to stop at specific points during code execution.
* Tracking variables to ensure their values meet our expectations at different points throughout the code's execution.
* Using try/catch statements in our code to handle errors gracefully, should they occur.

The syntax for try/catch statements is as follows:

try {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;code block;<br>
} catch (error) {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;code block;<br>
} finally {<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;code block;<br>
}
