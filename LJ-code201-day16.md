# Code 201, Day 16

On Monday we finished the basic planning for our course project.  We spent a lot of time going through our user scenarios and converting them to user stories and technical requirements. We were able to hammer out what we wanted in our MVP and came up with a few reasonable stretch goals. After that we began creating some of the framework for our site.  We finished the day by starting the process of gathering data for our hiking application.
